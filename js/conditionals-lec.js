// Conditionals: Code that runs when we meet certain requirements.

// Today we'll be covering if, if/else, if/else if/else statements, ternary expressions and switch statements.

// IF STATEMENTS - Code that runs when a condition is met.

// if (condition) {
//     this code will run if our condition is true;
// }

/** Consider the sentence: "When I run out of milk, I go to the store to get more." */

// } else {
//     otherwise i run;
// }

// IF/ELSE IF/ELSE = A chain of if/else statements to give different results for different conditions.
